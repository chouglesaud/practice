# Basics of OOP

Object-oriented programming is a paradigm based on the con-
cept of wrapping pieces of data, and behavior related to that
data, into special bundles called objects, which are construct-
ed from a set of “blueprints”, defined by a programmer, called
classes.

# Pillars of OOP

-   Abstraction
-   Encapsulation
-   Inheritance
-   Polymorphism

# Relations Between Objects

-   Association
-   Dependency
-   Composition
-   Aggregation

# Design Principles

-   Encapsulate What Varies
-   Program to an Interface, not an Implementation
-   Favor Composition Over Inheritance

# SOLID Principles

-   Single Responsibility Principle
-   Open-Closed Principle
-   Liskov Substitution Principle
-   Interface Segregation Principle
-   Dependency Inversion Principle

# Design Pattern

Design patterns are usually categorized into three major groups.

### Creational Design Patterns

-   Factory Pattern
-   Prototype Pattern
-   Singleton Pattern
-   Builder Pattern

### Structural Design Patterns

-   Adapter Pattern
-   Bridge Pattern
-   Composite Pattern
-   Decorator Pattern
-   Façade Pattern
-   Flyweight Pattern // performance
-   Proxy Pattern. // performance

### Behavioral Design Patterns

-   Chain of Responsibility Pattern
-   Command Pattern
-   Iterator Pattern
-   Mediator Pattern
-   Memento Pattern
-   Observer Pattern
-   State Pattern
-   Strategy Pattern
-   Template Pattern
